Search a 2D matrix

Given a 2D matrix where the rows and columns both are sorted you need to find the target in the matrix

sorted matrix -> 2 pointer approach, it is how to figure the vaalues of the pointer
if we take both pointer in a row then if we need one more pointer which points to the end of the column so that we can see in a range

We can keep a pointer to last of row and to start of column
  then check if the number>target we need to do row--
  else if target>number we need to do col++

bool searchMatrix(vector<vector<int>>& matrix, int target) {
    int row=matrix.size()-1,col=0;
    while(row>=0 && col<matrix[0].size()){
        if(matrix[row][col]>target){
            row--;
        }
        else if(matrix[row][col]<target){
            col++;
        }
        else{
            return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
}
