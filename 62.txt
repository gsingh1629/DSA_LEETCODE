Unique Paths

given a m and n, you need to tell if a robot is placed at matrix[0][0] and we have to go to matrix[m-1][n-1], if robot can move only right or down, we need to tell
number of ways in which robot can reach m-1,n-1

as we can see in row=0 and col=0, there is only 1 way because it can move right or down
and also i,j depends on i-1,j and i,j-1 so we need to traverse the matrix and check for these locations

Also this is a 2d DP as this question can be divided into subproblems and each subproblem depends on previous one

int uniquePaths(int m, int n) {
    vector<vector<int>> res(m, vector<int> (n,1));
    for(int i=1;i<m;i++){
        for(int j=1;j<n;j++){
            res[i][j]=res[i-1][j]+res[i][j-1];
        }
    }
    return res[m-1][n-1];
}
