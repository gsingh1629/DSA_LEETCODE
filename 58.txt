Length of last word

given a string we need to tell the length of the last word present in that string

we can start from end of the string and traverse in backward direction 
  check if it is space that move the pointer
  if it is character than count the length of the that word

int lengthOfLastWord(string s) {
    int i=s.size()-1,res=0;
    while(i>=0 && s[i]==' '){
        i--;
    }
    while(i>=0 && s[i]!=' '){
        res++;
        i--;
    }
    return res;
}
