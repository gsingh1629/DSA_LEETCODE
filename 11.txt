Container with most water
given an array representing the heights
find the max water we can have if consider as a container

One approach is that we can go for double loop and check at each index with respect to every other index
Other one is we can have two pointer approach where we (a type of) shrink the indexes 

int maxArea(vector<int>& height) {
    //Two Pointer approach
    int res=0;
    int left=0,right=height.size()-1;
    while(left<right){
        //adjust the indexes according to smaller height
        int area=(right-left)*(height[left]<height[right]?height[left++]:height[right--]);
        res=max(res,area);
    }
    return res;
}
