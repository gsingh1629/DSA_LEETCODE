First Unique Character in String

We need to return the index of the first character which is unique in the string 

We can have a map to store the occurence of the character then traverse that map to check the character with count == 1 and return its index

int firstUniqChar(string s) {
    unordered_map<char,int> mp;
    for(auto c:s){
        mp[c]++;
    }
    for(int i=0;i<s.size();i++){
        if(mp[s[i]]==1){
            return i;
        }
    }
    return -1;
}
