Remove nth node from the end of the linked list

Given a linked list and integer n remove the nth node from the end of the linked list

One is we can check the length of the linked list and according to that we can delete the node 

We can also use TWO POINTER approach i.e using a slow and fast pointer

We can go to nth node by using fast pointer and then check if it is null or not, if it is null then that means we need to delete the first node
then we got to the end of the list by traversing fast pointer till the next is null and simultaneously we traverse slow pointer 
Then just update the next pointer of the slow to next of next of slow

ListNode* removeNthFromEnd(ListNode* head, int n) {
    ListNode *slow=head,*fast=head;
    for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
        fast=fast->next;
    }
    if(fast==NULL){//i.e. n is equal to length 
        return head->next;
    }
    while(fast->next!=NULL){
        slow=slow->next;
        fast=fast->next;
    }
    slow->next=slow->next->next;
    return head;
}
